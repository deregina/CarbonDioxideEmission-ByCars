# Emissions by Cars
[Data Source: Emissions by Cars] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/co2-emissions-by-cars-in-canada

- What is this data about?
> This data contains information about various cars, including model, make, vehicle type, CO2 emission and so on. 

- What is your research objectives and goals?
> The goal of this research is finding the relatioship between car features and the amount of CO2 emission. 

- The reason that I chose this dataset?
> CO2 emissions are increasing rapidly and this is having a negative impact on the overall environment. Although people are trying to change their car fuel from coal fuel to electricity, a complete transition will take a long time. Therefore, it would be also a good policy to encourage car manufacturers to make coal-fueled cars with lower CO2 emissions. To achieve this, research must be conducted to reveal the relationship between the characteristics of vehicles and CO2 emissions. In general, it is easy to expect that fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are closely related. It would be interesting and helpful to find out which features are causing more CO2 emissions.

- Questions about the dataset  

> - #### Is the range of the CO2 emission large? Is it widely distributed?  
If the range of CO2 emissions is large, it may be more meaningful to find out what causes the differences.  
  
> - #### Is there a relationship between the nationality of the car makers?  
If there is, we can assume that government policies of the country is affecting the fuel efficiency of the cars and conduct further researches. Because this dataset does not have information about the nationality, I will add a column.   

> - #### Is there a relationship between the nationality of the car makers and CO2 emissions?  
The first factor is expected to be fuel consumption. It would be interesting to know what other factors affect CO2 emissions.  

> - #### What type of fuel is emitting the most CO2?  
If a type of fuel is emitting much more CO2 that others, it will be meaningful reducing the use of the fuel.
